# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised learning, Transformation and Clustering, PCA
## Overview of the project 
Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. Since there is no known output for what to looking for, need to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, use a clustering algorithm. Finallay, use data visualizations to share findings with the board.
## Approaches
- preprocessing (cleaning, scaling) the database,
- using Principal Component Analysis to see the data in dimentional reduction,
- clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means algorithm,
- visualizing classified results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
